The objective of Rotation is to get all 11 possible sums when rolling 2 die in as few rolls as possible.

In the console, the game will print the instructions. Then for each round the user will have to type "roll" to begin the round after being prompted. 

The round number, rolled sum, and whether there is an open slot for that sum will then be printed into the console.

The user can also type in "min" and "max" once to access bonuses. The min bonus rolls each of the die 4 times, taking the smallest values for each of the die, and giving the sum. The max bonus does the same, but for larger values.

Once the user has gotten all of the sums, the game will end, and the user will not be able to continue rolling.
